### Lombok does boilerplate for us. It has IDE support for:
> - Setters
> - Getters
> - Equals
> - Hashcode
> - ToString

> ### Pro-tip: search around on Google to learn what Getters and Setters are

> Pro-tip: search around on Google to learn a DTO is in Java
{: .prompt-tip }

### An @ annotation will generate all boilerplate for us with Lombok
~~~
@Builder
@Setter
@Getter
@Data
@EqualsandHashcode
@NoArgsConstructor
@AllAArgsConstructor
@NonNull
~~~

> ### Pro-tip: If these things are completely new to you, better step up your game. 
{: .prompt-warning }
> This is all about Objects,and programming is all about Objects too.

> #### Public is the default access level for getters and setters unless you change it.
{: .prompt-danger }
> We will learn about Public and Private access levels soon.

## Add Lombok to project/ pom.xml (Maven)
This is an important step if you work with Lombok, fortunately you already know what maven is, and when we get to Spring
and their starter, you will discover that you can easily pick up Lombok for any project. 
This will make you a great developer.



### Add Maven Dependency for Lombok in the pom.xml
~~~
        <!-- compile dependencies -->
        <dependencies>
            <dependency>
                <groupId>org.projectlombok</groupId>
                <artifactId>lombok</artifactId>
                <scope>provided</scope>
            </dependency>
        </dependencies>
~~~
_This is the example code that you can copy-pasta into your pom.xml to start using Lombok._

This will teach you a lot about Lombok. But perhaps it's just enough to watch these clips for now. Today is all about
awareness of Lombok, and the superpower it can bestow on you when you know how to handle this infinity stone.
