# Start of the Java developer

Welcome to square one, young Padawan. This is my collection of information. I arranged it so that the next person does not have to invent the wheel again. But to become a programmer, there are some things you should know.
What you need is knowledge and experience. Don't worry about experience, we will look at a free course that gives you 300 - 500 hours of experience in writing Java.
And don't worry about knowledge, take your time and don't rush it. Take my course here for 1 blog post a day. Browse it, read it, watch some movies and ultimately, follow the tutorials and exercise.
Exercise, exercise, exercise. May the force be with you.

You will learn in this course to use Java 17 or higher
with [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/)
and [MapStruct](https://mapstruct.org/).

## Code Gym
```java
 public static void main(String[] args)
```

### [Start daily exercises in a Code Gym](https://codegym.cc/nl/quests/lectures/nl.questsyntax.level00.lecture02)
Look at this website and do 3-5 lessons to get started. it might take you 15 minutes, but probably less. 
> It has a too long intro but the experience is vital
