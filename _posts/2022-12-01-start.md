# Start of the Java developer

Welcome to square one, young Padawan. This is my collection of information. I arranged it so that the next person does
not have to invent the wheel again. But to become a programmer, there are some things you should know.
What you need is knowledge and experience. Don't worry about experience, we will look at a free course that gives you
300 - 500 hours of experience in writing Java.
And don't worry about knowledge, take your time and don't rush it. Take my course here for 1 blog post a day. Browse it,
read it, watch some movies and ultimately, follow the tutorials and exercise.
Exercise, exercise, exercise. May the force be with you.

You will learn in this course to use Java 17 or higher
with [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), [Project Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/)
and [MapStruct](https://mapstruct.org/).

## Love for the profession cannot be forced.

- programming = frustration

> don't give up.

- a hockey stick learning curve

> You will learn a lot in a short time, but when the real work starts you don't feel ready and you think you know
> little. You can learn what you don't know, and you are always learning. Remember that.
{: .prompt-warning }

- when you are stuck you also learn

> thinking about how to solve a problem is most of the work and the key of this profession, if you know how to solve a
> problem, making the solution is a matter of time.
{: .prompt-info }

- if you don't know how to proceed, go for a walk, for real, like literally walk for 10 minutes or more, go around the
  block, or something.

> It is important to take a break, to interrupt your process, walking is good for processing information in the brain

Do you still feel like getting started? Then you first must delve into the following thinking method; this method helps to
make tasks and assignments more overview-able, and when you make a task small enough, there is always a part of the work
that you can do.

## Code Gym

You will have to dream this:

```java
 public static void main(String[]args)
```

{: .nolineno }

This is where the magic happens

### [Start daily exercises in a Code Gym](https://codegym.cc/)

Look at this website and do 3-5 lessons to get started. it might take you 15 minutes, but probably less. You will
quickly learn how the magic works. Within a week you will be able to program a calculator.
